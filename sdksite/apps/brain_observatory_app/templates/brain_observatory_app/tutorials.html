						We need to get you up to speed on visual coding
						and understanding the stimuli we used during our experiments. Simply put, visual coding is a 
						process by which neurons respond and adapt to changing visual stimuli. we used a set of both natural and 
						artificial visual stimuli to evoke cellular responses. The cellular activity was observed 
						through in vivo calcium imaging from GCaMP6-expressing neurons in selected brain areas, 
						cortical areas, and Cre lines. Now, let's understand the different stimuli!
