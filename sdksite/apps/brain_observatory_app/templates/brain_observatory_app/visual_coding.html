						process by which neurons respond and adapt to changing visual stimuli. we used a set of both natural and 
						artificial visual stimuli to evoke cellular responses. The cellular activity was observed 
						through in vivo calcium imaging from GCaMP6-expressing neurons in selected brain areas, 
						cortical areas, and Cre lines. Now, let's understand the different stimuli!

							The cellular responses acquired during the presentation of the drifting grating stimulus provide
							data to help characterize visual tuning properties of cells, such as orientation tuning (a preference
							for a grating orientation), direction preference, and temporal frequency tuning (a preference for a
							specific temporal frequency).

							<h5 class="left-align">Visual of Stimulus</h5>
							The drifting grating stimulus consists of a full-field sinusoidal grating that drifts in a 
							direction perpendicular to the orientation of the grating. In this experiment, the grating drifts in 
							one of eight directions, at 45Â° intervals, and at one of five temporal frequencies, ranging from 1 to 
							15 cycles per second, resulting in 40 distinct grating conditions. The presentation of the visual 
							stimulus is as follows; a grating condition is presented for 2 seconds, and is followed by 1 second 
							of mean luminance gray before the next grating condition is presented. Each of the 40 grating conditions 
							is repeated 15 times, in a random order, and there are intermittent blank sweeps throughout the stimulus 
							(i.e. the 2 second grating condition is replaced with 2 seconds of mean luminance gray).

							<h5 class="left-align">Evaluating cellular responses to the Dtrifting Grating visual Stimulus</h5>
							By comparing the responses to each of the 40 grating conditions, as measured by an increase in
							fluorescence due to increased calcium concentration, visual tuning properties such as orientation
							tuning, direction preference, and temporal frequency tuning are evaluated. Typically, the orientation 
							tuning would be represented by plotting the mean response (from 15 trials) to all eight directions at 
							the preferred temporal frequency, while the temporal frequency tuning would be represented by plotting 
							the mean response to all five temporal frequency conditions at the preferred grating direction.

							<h5 class="left-align">Data Visualization</h5>
							To simplify data visualization, the cellular response to the drifting grating stimulus is represented 
							using the "Star" plot. Each arm of this figure represents a grating drift direction, while each ring represents 
							the temporal frequency of the grating. At each intersection, the responses from 15 trials are ranked, and 
							represented as a single red dot, the intensity of which corresponds to the strength of the response.

							With this visualization, the orientation or direction tuning of a cell within a visual field can be quickly 
							evaluated. Likewise, the temporal frequency tuning can be evaluated by comparing the responses along one axis. 
							Further, by comparing the fifteen trials across a given visual stimulus, trial-to-trial variability can be assessed.

							<h5 class="left-align">Importance</h5>
							The cellular responses acquired during the presentation of the static grating stimulus provide data to help characterize visual tuning properties of cells, such as the spatial frequency tuning and the orientation tuning of the cells, providing a finer measurement of orientation than provided from the drifting grating stimulus.

							<h5 class="left-align">Visual of Stimulus</h5>
							The static grating stimulus consists of a full field sinusoidal grating, that varies in orientation (the angle of the grating), spatial frequency (the width of the grating), and phase (the position of the grating). In this dataset, 6 orientations (at 30Â° intervals), 5 spatial frequencies (0.02 â 0.32 cycles/Â°), and 4 phases are used resulting in a total of 120 stimulus conditions. Each grating is presented briefly (250 ms) before being replaced with a different orientation, spatial frequency and phase condition. Each condition is presented 50 times, in random order, with intermittent blank sweeps.

							</div>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5 class="left-align">Evaluating cellular responses to the Static Gratings Visual Stimulus</h5>
							Capturing the responses to all 120 static grating conditions has up to this point required several figures. Two-dimensional heatmaps can capture the orientation and spatial frequency tuning for each phase. Alternately, the spatial frequency tuning can be plotted at the preferred orientation for each phase, or reciprocally, the orientation tuning can be plotted at the preferred spatial frequency, also at each phase.

							</div>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5 class="left-align">Visualization</h5>
							To capture the cellular responses of all these conditions in a single figure, the cellular responses to each static grating are being represented using the "Fan" plot. Each arm represents the orientation of the grating, while each arc represents a spatial frequency with the lowest frequency near the center of the plot and higher frequencies radiating outward. At the intersections of these axes are four lobes, each corresponding to a different phase. Each dot represents the response to a single trial of that grating condition, the color and intensity corresponding to the strength of the response. In this way, the rank-ordered dots capture both the strength and the trial-to-trial variability of the cellÂs response to each condition.

							The cellular responses acquired during the presentation of the Locally Sparse Noise stimulus provide data to help characterize visual tuning properties of cells, such as definition of the spatial receptive field, including both On and Off subunits.

							<h5 class="left-align">Visual of Stimulus</h5>
							Conventionally, the spatial dimensions of the receptive field have been measured with a sparse noise stimulus, which consists of a mean luminance gray display with a single white or black spot presented briefly in different locations. This stimulus allows the visual field to be fully sampled with both light (On) and dark (Off) stimuli to map the extent of the cells' receptive fields. Complete sampling of all positions in the visual field can require hours of visual stimulus data collection.

							</div>
							<br>
							<br>
							To examine the spatial extent of the receptive fields in an efficient manner, a "Locally Sparse Noise" stimulus was developed. In this display, multiple black and white spots are presented in each stimulus frame (250 ms each). Each spot is 4.65 on a side, and is surrounded by a spatial exclusion zone of 23 that is not occupied by any other spot. To better map receptive fields in higher visual areas, we also present a stimulus that has larger 9.3 spots, and a 46.5 degree exclusions zone, in experiments released in June 2017. Please note that the NWB files and Allen SDK refer to these two stimuli as Locally Sparse Noise 4 deg and Locally Sparse Noise 8 deg respectively.Locally sparse noise

							<h5 class="left-align">Evaluating cellular responses to the Locally Sparse Noise visual Stimulus</h5>
							To map the receptive field structure, the cellular response is averaged over all trials (~115 trials) when a given location is occupied by a spot, (i.e., a white spot). While there were other spots present in the stimulus for this particular trial, the arrangement of these spots was always different, such that the effect of the other spots on a cell's response should average away. A heatmap of a cell's On responses is created by looking at these average responses for each location in the visual field. Similarly, a heatmap of the cell's Off responses can be created by looking at the responses for the black spots across all locations.

							</div>		
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5 class="left-align">Visualization</h5>
							The spatial receptive field for each cell is represented by two plots, showing the locations where the cell responded to white pixels (On) and black pixels (Off). For both On and Off, the mask of responsive pixels, created using a p-value map with multiple comparison correction, is applied to the stimulus average of responsive trials. The result is that only responsive pixels are shown, the strength of their response being indicated by the darkness of the color (red for On, blue for Off). This visualization captures the structure of On and Off subunits in the cell's spatial receptive field.

							</div>
							<br>
							<br>
							Consistent with the other visualizations in the Allen Brain Observatory, a figure highlighting the trial-to-trial variability of the responses to this stimulus, or the "Pincushion" plot, was created. For each location in visual space, all of the trials for an On stimulus are ranked and represented as dots, whose red hue corresponds to the strength of that trial. The same is done for the off stimulus in blue plots. This visualization not only shows the locations of strong responses to the On and Off stimuli (e.g. the On and Off subunits), but also reveals where the presence of the On or Off stimulus causes a suppression of activity, evidenced by a smaller number of red or blue dots than in surrounding areas.

							Data gathered from each image are represented along a ray extending from the center circle in the "Corona" plot. The cellular response to each image presentation is represented by a single dot, where the color corresponds to the intensity of the response. Dots are arranged with the strongest response positioned at the core, with lower intensity responses radiating away from the center. This representation allows viewers to easily determine which images elicited the greatest cellular response, and reveals cells that have particularly selective responses in comparison to cells that respond broadly to the presentation of a variety of images.
